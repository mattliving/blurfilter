Filter.xc uses a box-blur filter to blur the input image concurrently using a pre-defined number of worker threads. The input and output images, as well as the image height, width and number of worker threads, are defined at the top of the file.

NOTE: This program is designed to be run on an XMOS XC-1A quad-core Development Board - http://www.xmos.com/products/development-kits/xc-1a-development-kit
